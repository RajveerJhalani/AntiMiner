## Overview

AntiMiner is a tool designed to detect stealthy or hidden miners and suspicious processes that may disappear when you open Task Manager. By using PowerShell, AntiMiner captures snapshots of running processes before and after Task Manager is opened. This process helps reveal hidden threats, providing executable paths and locations for further investigation. AntiMiner is easy to run, free, and open source.

## Installation

To get started with AntiMiner, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/RajveerJhalani/AntiMiner/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system, and follow the instructions to execute it.

### Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- PowerShell

## Usage

To run AntiMiner, follow these steps:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded AntiMiner.
3. Execute the script by typing:

   ```powershell
   .\AntiMiner.ps1
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to start the scanning process.

### Example Output

After running the script, you will receive a report detailing any hidden miners detected. The report will include:

- Process names
- Executable paths
- Locations of the processes

## How It Works

AntiMiner operates in a straightforward manner:

1. **Initial Snapshot**: The tool takes an initial snapshot of all running processes.
2. **Task Manager Check**: When you open Task Manager, some processes may hide themselves.
3. **Final Snapshot**: After Task Manager is opened, AntiMiner takes a second snapshot.
4. **Comparison**: The tool compares both snapshots to identify any processes that have vanished.

This method effectively reveals hidden threats that could compromise your system's security.
